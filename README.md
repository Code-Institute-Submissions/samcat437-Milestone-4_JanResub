### Test Cases based on User Stories



## Deployment 

### Via Heroku 

I used Heroku.com to host my app. This website ran the python code and produced a live link which can be found [here](). Heroku connects to GitHub and with every push updates the site on Heroku.

1. In the gitpod terminal, a requirements.txt and a Procfile are first created by using the following commands:
pip3 freeze â€“local > requirements.txt and echo web: python app.py > Procfile
2. The new files are then committed to GitHub.
3. In Heroku.com, a new account is created, followed by a new app. Europe is then chosen as the region nearest geographically for free service. Amazon Web Services were also chosen as the provider.
4. Next, the Deployment Method of Connecting to GitHub is selected.
Within the search bar, the repository name is entered and the correct repository (Milestone-4) is selected to connect via the button. Automatic deploys are enabled from the main branch.
5. In the settings tab, the Config Vars information needs to be filled out very carefully. If these contain discrepencies, the app will not run. These included the following fields: DATABASE_URL, HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_RED_URL, IP, MONGO_DBNAME, MONGO_URI, PORT and SECRET_KEY. These fields correspond to the respective MongoDB, Heroku Postgresql add-on, Port and IP information as appropriate for your project. These are not disclosed her for security of the site.
6. "Deploy Branch" was selected and the app is successfully built. 

### Via Gitpod ran locally

1. Navigate to the Github repository at [here]().
2. Choose "Gitpod."
3. In the Bash terminal, type: `python3 manage.py runserver`
4. Choose "Make Public" when a blue button appears.
5. Choose "Open Browser" when the options appears.
